# FullStack-App-React-Rest-API
 Project 10

This project uses React to create a client for my existing school database Rest API Project 9. The full stack application will provide a way for users to administer a school database containing information about courses: users can interact with the database by retrieving a list of courses, viewing detail for a specific course, as well as creating, updating and deleting courses in the database.
